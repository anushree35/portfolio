# Setup Guide for ELA Learning Platform

## 🚀 Getting Your Project Ready for GitHub

### Step 1: Install Git (if not already installed)
If you see an error about developer tools when running Git commands, you'll need to install them:

1. Open Terminal
2. Run: `xcode-select --install`
3. Follow the installation prompts
4. Alternatively, install Git from: https://git-scm.com/download/mac

### Step 2: Initialize Git Repository
Once Git is installed, run these commands in your project directory:

```bash
cd ~/ela-learning-platform
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: ELA Learning Platform - Girl Scout Silver Award Project 2022"
```

### Step 3: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name your repository: `ela-learning-platform`
5. Add description: "ELA Learning Platform for children ages 2-14 - Girl Scout Silver Award Project 2022"
6. Make it public (so others can see your great work!)
7. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
8. Click "Create repository"

### Step 4: Connect Local Repository to GitHub
Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ela-learning-platform.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 5: Update README with Your GitHub Username
Edit the `README.md` file and replace `yourusername` in the clone command with your actual GitHub username.

## 🌐 Viewing Your Project

### Local Development
